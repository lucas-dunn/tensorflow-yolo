# TensorFlow YOLO

## Project Overview
**tensorflow-yolo** is an implementation of YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection in TensorFlow, aiming to deliver an efficient and high-performance solution for real-time object detection tasks. This repository provides the full source code for training and evaluating YOLO models with TensorFlow.

## Features
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Built with YOLOv3, known for its speed and accuracy.
- **Custom Dataset Training**: Capability to train on custom datasets, allowing for the detection of various object types.
- **TensorFlow 2 Support**: Fully compatible with TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring efficient computation and integration with the TensorFlow ecosystem.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Easy access to pre-trained weights for fast model initialization.
- **Optimized Performance**: Fine-tuned configurations for high performance on both CPU and GPU.

## Installation
